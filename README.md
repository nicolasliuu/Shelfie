# Shelfie 

This is Shelfie, the next generation of smart fridge software.

## What does this do?

Shelfie employs state-of-the-art image recognition techniques to accurately recognize produce and products that have an expiration date. Artificial intelligence suggests recipes that the user may be able to make with the ingredients in the fridge based on their dietary preferences and needs.

## Future Development

We plan to employ higher-definition, more efficient image-processing techniques to more accurately read and analyze the barcode of a product. Integrating better AI models, such as GPT-4 and Hugging Face models, is also on the horizon. With AI, we also want to be able to suggest healthier alternatives to some of the products that the user has in their refrigerator. We also want to deploy a reminder system that will tell the user if their produce is about to expire.
